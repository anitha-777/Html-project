    <h2> How I Cook – My Recipe Process</h2> </center>
    
<center>
    Cooking is a journey filled with flavor, creativity, and joy. Here’s how I bring each recipe to life in my kitchen:
<br>
<br>
    <b>🔪 1. Gather Fresh Ingredients </b>
Every great dish begins with quality. I choose fresh vegetables, spices, and other ingredients to ensure the best taste and nutrition.

<br>
<br>
<b>📖 2. Read and Plan the Recipe</b>
I always read the full recipe first to understand the steps. Planning ahead helps save time and avoid mistakes.
<br>
<br>

<b>🧂 3. Prep Work</b>
Chopping veggies, grinding spices, marinating ingredients — preparation is key! I do all the prep before turning on the stove.
<br>
<br>
<b>
🔥 4. Cook with Patience </b>
I cook on the right flame, stir with care, and never rush the process. Letting flavors develop slowly makes all the difference.
<br>
<br>
<b>🧪 5. Taste and Adjust</b>
As I cook, I keep tasting and adjusting salt, spice, or tang to make sure everything is balanced and flavorful.
<br>
<br>
<b>🍽️ 6. Presentation</b>
A dish should look as good as it tastes! I serve my recipes with care — garnished with herbs, arranged neatly, and served warm.

<br>
<br>
<b>💬 7. Share the Joy</b>
Cooking is better when shared. I love sharing my recipes with friends, family, and now — with you!
